# Evaluation for "Hop-By-Hop: Advancing Cooperative Congestion Control for Cyber-Physical Systems"

This folder contains the simulation configuration and post-processing tools used in:

M. Jung und M. Zitterbart, [*Hop-By-Hop: Advancing Cooperative Congestion Control for Cyber-Physical Systems*](https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN52139.2021.9524887), 2021 46th IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN).

## Steps to reproduce results:

1. Setup environment by sourcing setenv as described in cocpn-sim root folder
2. Compile cocpn-sim by invoking ``make``.
    * Hint: passing "``make MODE=release``" significantly improves simulation performance.
3. ``cd`` into this directory and invoke ``make``. This will run all simulations and extract the results to "``/results-fourhop``". Especially the last step takes some time and RAM. You may parallelize this process by adding ``-j2`` as argument to ``make``.
    * External requirement: pixz
4. Plots can be generated by using the notebooks in "``/analysis``".
    * External requirements: Jupyter, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pint
